# Superstore Sales EDA
This project contains an exploratory data analysis of the dataset titled superstore sales, which contains the sales data of a US store for over four years.

# Major Steps
1. Primary columns relating to a superstore in the dataset were explored through their shapes, unique values and descriptive statistics.

2. The dataset columns were explored in a sequential manner, and visualisations were made on the column being explored and compared to other columns, such as sales - univariate and bivariate analysis.

3. Analysis of explorations are added in the Python notebook file.

4. The graphs and charts, including ones from Plotly Express, are present in the attached summary pdf.
